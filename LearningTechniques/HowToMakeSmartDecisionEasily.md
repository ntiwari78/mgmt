# Briefing Document: How To Make Smart Decision Easily

**Date:** 26 October 2023

## Purpose

This briefing summarises key themes and findings from the source **“How to make smart decisions more easily,”** focusing on **decision fatigue** and its implications, evidence, and practical mitigation strategies.

---

## 1) What Is Decision Fatigue?

**Decision fatigue** is a state of cognitive exhaustion that emerges **after extended periods of decision‑making**, degrading choice quality (more impulsivity, less confidence) across both high‑stakes and everyday contexts.
**Learn more:** [Decision fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue)

---

## 2) Evidence of Decision Fatigue

**2011 Parole Study (Judicial Decisions):**
People reviewed by judges **in the morning were more likely to receive parole** than those reviewed later in the day. Researchers attributed this to **fatigue** affecting judgment as the day progressed, suggesting time‑of‑day can override case specifics.
**Source:** Danziger, Levav & Avnaim‑Pesso (2011), *PNAS* — [Extraneous factors in judicial decisions](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1018033108)

> Note: Subsequent commentary discusses alternative explanations (e.g., case ordering). The finding remains a landmark illustration of potential time‑of‑day effects on complex decisions.

## 3) How Decision Fatigue Manifests & Impacts Results

* **Depletion of decision resources:** People appear to have a daily threshold for high‑quality choices; beyond it, they defer or simplify decisions.
  Related concepts: [Ego depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion) (debated).
* **Increased impulsivity & reduced confidence:** Choices skew toward defaults, shortcuts, or avoidance.
* **Threshold varies by:**

  * **Frequency:** Many choices → faster depletion.
  * **Complexity & novelty:** Unfamiliar, multi‑criteria decisions consume more cognitive effort.
* **Low‑stakes / frequent choices:** e.g., breakfast; limited options and routine allow recovery between choices.
* **High‑stakes / infrequent / complex choices:** e.g., replacing a car; many options, research, and trade‑offs can **consume the day’s “decision budget.”**
* **Occupational hazards:**

  * **Judges:** Back‑to‑back difficult rulings, limited recovery time.
  * **Medical workers:** Long shifts and critical, repeated choices elevate error risk.
    Evidence on extended shifts: Landrigan et al., *NEJM* (2004) — longer resident work hours → **more serious medical errors**.

## 4) Strategies to Combat Decision Fatigue

**A. Reduce Daily Decisions**

* Batch or sequence tasks across days.
* Remove or automate rote choices (e.g., standard meals, preset wardrobes, defaults).
* Related reading: [Choice architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_architecture)

**B. Adopt an External Perspective**

* It’s typically easier to advise others than yourself; simulate a **third‑person view** before deciding.
* Related effect: [Solomon’s paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon%27s_paradox)

**C. Prioritise and Relax**

* Not every decision merits maximal effort; **satisfice** on minor choices to conserve energy for major ones.
* Concept: [Satisficing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing)

**D. Time & Energy Management**

* Make important decisions **earlier in the day** (or after breaks).
* Use brief **breaks**, **nutrition**, and **sleep** to restore capacity.
* For sustained work, structure sessions (e.g., **Pomodoro**) to interleave focus and recovery.
  Method: [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

# **Study Guide: Understanding Decision Fatigue**

---

## **I. Quiz**

1. **What surprising variable significantly influenced parole decisions in the 2011 study, and what was the researchers' explanation?**
   The study found that **time of day** had a large impact — morning parole hearings were more successful. Researchers attributed this to **[decision fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue)**, suggesting judges were likely exhausted in the afternoon.

2. **Define decision fatigue and explain how it affects an individual's decision-making abilities.**
   Decision fatigue is a state of **cognitive exhaustion** after extended decision-making. It makes individuals **more impulsive** and **less confident** in choices.

3. **How does the human body's energy consumption relate to decision-making, according to the text?**
   All bodily actions — physical or mental — use energy. While the exact resource depleted is unclear, individuals seem to have a **daily decision-making threshold**.

4. **What happens once an individual reaches their daily decision-making threshold?**
   Most people choose to “**take it easy**” and postpone serious thinking about new decisions to conserve cognitive energy.

5. **Identify three variables that influence how quickly one reaches their decision-making threshold.**

   * **Frequency** of decisions
   * **Complexity** of decisions
   * **Novelty** of decisions

6. **Compare and contrast the energy expenditure of choosing breakfast versus replacing a broken-down car.**

   * **Breakfast:** Low stakes, frequent, limited options — less taxing.
   * **Replacing a car:** Unexpected, complex, high stakes — requires hours of research, quickly depletes decision capacity.

7. **Why is decision fatigue a significant concern in professions like judging and medicine?**
   These roles demand **multiple high-stakes decisions back-to-back** with little recovery time, increasing risk of critical mistakes.

8. **List two institutional changes that could address decision fatigue in demanding professions.**
   (Inferred from text)

   * Shorter shifts or mandatory breaks
   * Workload distribution and systemic decision support

9. **Suggest two direct strategies individuals can employ to avoid decision fatigue in their daily lives.**

   * Make fewer daily decisions (batch tasks, remove rote decisions)
   * Imagine decisions as if they were someone else’s to reduce personal emotional load

10. **What is the final piece of advice offered to help individuals conserve energy for important decisions?**
    Recognise not every choice is equally important — **relax about small decisions** to save energy for major ones.

## **II. Answer Key**

*(Condensed form for quick marking)*

* **Variable:** Time of day — mornings more favourable due to less fatigue.
* **Definition:** Cognitive exhaustion → impulsivity & reduced confidence.
* **Relation:** Energy use for all actions; daily threshold for decisions.
* **Outcome:** Delay complex decisions when threshold reached.
* **Variables:** Frequency, complexity, novelty.
* **Breakfast vs. Car:** Low-stakes routine vs. high-stakes complex.
* **Concern in Professions:** Multiple consecutive high-stakes choices, little recovery.
* **Institutional Fixes:** Shorter shifts, breaks, workload management.
* **Strategies:** Reduce decisions, externalise perspective.
* **Advice:** Focus energy on important decisions.

   Discuss why complex and novel decisions are more taxing than routine ones.

2. **Discuss the ethical implications of decision fatigue in high-stakes professions.**
   Consider potential consequences for individuals and society.

3. **Evaluate the effectiveness of suggested individual strategies.**
   Are they universally applicable? What are the limits?

4. **Propose institutional changes to mitigate decision fatigue in demanding professions.**
   Include both practical and cultural adjustments.

5. **Reflect on societal implications of widespread decision fatigue.**
   How does it affect personal well-being, productivity, and everyday decision quality?

# **Decision Fatigue — Summary Guide**

---

## **What Is Decision Fatigue?**

**Decision fatigue** is a form of **[cognitive exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_fatigue)** that occurs after prolonged periods of decision-making.
It can make individuals:

* More **impulsive**
* Less **confident** in their choices

**Key Insight:** Our capacity for making sound decisions is a **finite resource** that can be depleted over time.
**Learn more:** [Decision fatigue — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue)

## **Real-World Evidence**

**2011 Parole Study** — *Danziger, Levav & Avnaim-Pesso* ([PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1018033108))

* **Finding:** Prisoners appearing **in the morning** before the parole board were far more likely to be granted parole than those appearing in the **afternoon**.
* **Explanation:** Judges’ mental energy declined over the day, leading to more conservative (denial) decisions later.

---

## **Factors Influencing the Decision-Making Threshold**

The speed at which you reach **decision fatigue** depends on:

1. **Frequency** — More choices = faster depletion.
2. **Complexity** — Multi-criteria or unclear outcomes are more taxing.
3. **Novelty** — Unfamiliar decisions require extra cognitive effort.

**Examples:**

* **Low-taxing:** Choosing breakfast — routine, few options, low stakes.
* **High-taxing:** Replacing a broken-down car — unexpected, many options, high stakes, requires hours of research.

---

## **Professions Most at Risk**

Roles involving **multiple high-stakes choices without breaks**:

* **Judges:** Back-to-back rulings (as in parole study)
* **Medical workers:** Long shifts filled with **life-or-death decisions**; error rates rise with fatigue ([Landrigan et al., 2004](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200410283511801))

---

## **Energy Consumption and Mental Work**

* **Mental decisions** consume energy just like physical tasks.
* Exact biological mechanisms remain unclear, but there appears to be a **daily “decision limit”**.
* Once reached, people tend to **avoid** or **delay** difficult choices to allow recovery.

---

## **Practical Strategies to Combat Decision Fatigue**

1. **Reduce Daily Decisions**

   * Spread tasks over multiple days.
   * Eliminate routine choices (e.g., preset meals, automated bill payments).
2. **Externalise Perspective**

   * Frame the decision as if advising someone else to reduce emotional strain.

---

## **Prioritising Decisions**

* **Not all choices are equally important** — let small ones slide.
* Save cognitive energy for **high-impact decisions** by selectively allocating attention.

---

## **Simple vs. Complex Decisions**

| **Simple Decision**              | **Complex Decision**                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Routine, predictable, low stakes | Unexpected, many options, high stakes |
| Few choices, minimal research    | Extensive research, multi-criteria    |
| Minimal energy use               | Highly taxing on cognitive resources  |
