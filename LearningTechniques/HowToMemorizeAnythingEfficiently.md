# Briefing: Efficient Memorisation Techniques

This briefing outlines two **scientifically proven and highly effective methods** for memorising information: **mnemonic cues** and **spaced repetition**. These methods leverage how the human brain naturally processes and retains information, offering efficient alternatives to rote learning.

## 1. Mnemonic Cues: The Power of Association and Storytelling

**Mnemonic cues** are mental devices that link new information to something familiar through **stories, images, or associations**.

### Key Insights

* **Mechanism**: Encountering a symbol or fact triggers the *associated story*, which retrieves the memory.
* **Counter-intuitive Effectiveness**: Adding a third element (the story) *makes recall easier*, not harder, by strengthening encoding.
* **Versatility**: Applicable to many domains — from learning [vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic), geography, anatomy, or even people’s names.
* **Example (Korean word for "umbrella")**: A student visualised the Korean symbol as resembling a roof/umbrella and created a vivid mental movie of it opening and closing.
* **Personalised Associations**: Unusual or quirky associations (“letters dripping over a big ear”) often work best.
* **Demonstrated Effectiveness**: Learners recalled the Korean word with a mnemonic far better than words presented without one.

## 2. Spaced Repetition: Optimising Review for Retention

**Spaced repetition** is a technique where information is reviewed at **increasing intervals**, reinforcing weaker knowledge more frequently.

### Key Insights

* **Core Principle**:

  * Well-known items → reviewed less often
  * Weak or unknown items → reviewed more frequently
* **Traditional Index Card Method**:

  * **Setup**: Question on one side, answer on the other
  * **If known** → card goes to the back (later review)
  * **If partially known** → card goes to the middle (soon review)
  * **If unknown/difficult** → card goes near the front (immediate re-exposure)
* **Efficiency**: Prevents wasting time on items already mastered, focusing effort where it’s most needed.
* **Variations & Tools**:

  * [Leitner System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) (tiered box method)
  * Digital tools such as [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), [Memrise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memrise), and [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) implement algorithmic spacing.
* **Underutilisation**: Despite strong evidence, many learners fail to use spaced repetition effectively.

## Conclusion

* **Mnemonic cues**: Strengthen encoding by turning abstract information into meaningful, personal stories.
* **Spaced repetition**: Optimises long-term retention by adjusting review frequency.

**Combined**, these techniques form a robust framework for **efficient memorisation** — applicable to languages, science, history, professional training, and more.
