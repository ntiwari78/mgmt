## 1. 🎯 Use Strategic Silence

* After making your key point, stop talking. Count to **10 slowly**.
* Silence creates pressure → the other side often fills it with concessions.
* **Tip**: State your position, then go completely silent.
* **Example**: “Your valuation is \$50M.” *(pause, count to 10)*

## 2. ❓ Ask *How*, Not *Why*

* Replace defensive “why” questions with collaborative “how” or “what.”
* Helps them solve problems while keeping control.
* **Tip**: Turn accusations into collaboration with *how* questions.
* **Example**: “How do you see us moving forward within these budget constraints?”

## 3. 😟 Address Their Fears

* Identify their biggest worry upfront.
* Makes them feel understood and lowers defenses.
* **Tip**: Start with *“You’re probably worried that…”*
* **Example**: “You’re probably worried this acquisition could destroy your company culture and eliminate jobs…”

## 4. 🪞 Mirror Their Words

* Repeat their last 2–3 words as a question.
* Encourages them to expand and reveal deeper priorities.
* **Tip**: Use upward inflection.
* **Example**: “The timeline is too aggressive.” → “Too aggressive?”

---

## 5. 🚫 Get Them to No

* Ask questions that trigger a safe “no.”
* “No” makes people feel protected, opening doors to real negotiation.
* **Tip**: Frame questions to invite protective *no* answers.
* **Example**: “Have you given up on making this partnership work this quarter?”

---

## 6. ✅ Confirm Their Concerns

* Paraphrase their needs so accurately they say *“That’s right.”*
* Builds trust and creates momentum for agreement.
* **Tip**: Summarize needs, constraints, and concerns completely.
* **Example**: “So you need board approval by March, gradual integration, and team protection?”

---

## 7. 📋 List Their Objections

* State their likely criticisms before they do.
* Neutralizes objections → they can’t use weapons you’ve already acknowledged.
* **Tip**: Be brutally honest about potential objections.
* **Example**: “You probably think we’re another tech startup that overpromises, burns cash, and disappears…”
