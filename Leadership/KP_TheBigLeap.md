# 🚀 *The Big Leap* — Gay Hendricks

**Conquer Your Hidden Fear and Take Life to the Next Level**
*Visual memo by Karina Stolz*

## 🔥 Core Idea: The Upper Limit Problem

* Everyone has a **“thermostat setting”** for how much **love, success, and creativity** we allow ourselves.
* When we exceed it, **self-sabotage kicks in** — pulling us back down.
* Signs: worrying thoughts, chronic criticism, self-blame, conflict, and limiting beliefs.

### 4 Hidden Fears Behind the Upper Limit

1. **I’m broken** (unworthy of success).
2. **Success causes disloyalty** (fear of rejection if you grow).
3. **I don’t want to outshine someone else.**
4. **I feel guilty for being a burden.**

👉 These fears block positive energy and keep us stuck.

## 🕰 Reframing Time & Conflict

* **Scarcity Mindset:** “I don’t have time for this.”
* **Abundance Mindset:** “I make as much time as I want for this.”
* **Conflict Resolution:** Requires both partners to take 100% responsibility (not 50/50).

## 🌟 The Zones of Work & Life

1. **Zone of Incompetence** → tasks you do poorly.
2. **Zone of Competence** → tasks you can do, but others can too.
3. **Zone of Excellence** → things you do very well, but that don’t light you up.
4. **Zone of Genius** →

   * Your true **superpower**.
   * Work that doesn’t feel like work.
   * Creates deep satisfaction and joy.
   * Where you’re meant to live every day.

## 🧘 Key Practice: The Mantra

> “I expand in love, success, and abundance every day, as I inspire those around me to do the same.”

## 🌟 Core Takeaway

The real leap in life = committing to live in your **Zone of Genius**, every single day, instead of settling for competence or excellence.
