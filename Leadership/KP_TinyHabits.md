# 🌱 Tiny Habits — BJ Fogg

**The Small Changes That Change Everything**

## 🔑 Fogg Behavior Model

$$
B = M \times A \times P
$$

**Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt**

* If motivation is high and ability is easy → action succeeds.
* If motivation is low or ability is hard → action fails.

### Steps to Solve Behavior Problems

1. Change the **prompt** (trigger)
2. Increase the **ability**
3. Change the **motivation** (last & hardest)

👉 **Fogg Maxims**:

* \#1: Help people do what they already want to do.
* \#2: Help people feel successful.

## 🛠️ The Behavior Design Process

### 1. Clarify the Aspiration

* Define your dream/goal clearly.
* Ask: *“This is really what I want?”*

### 2. Explore Behavior Options

* Brainstorm many possible behaviors.
* Look for “golden behaviors” that naturally help your aspiration.

### 3. Match with Specific Behaviors

* Choose behaviors that are both motivating and realistic.
* Don’t wait for “perfect motivation.”

### 4. Start Tiny

* Shrink the habit so small that it doesn’t require motivation.
* Example: Floss one tooth, do 1 push-up.

### 5. Find a Good Prompt

* Anchor the habit to something you already do.
* Formula: *After I \[anchor], I will \[new habit].*

### 6. Celebrate Successes

* Emotions create habits → celebration reinforces identity.
* Hack your brain with small wins and natural joy.

### 7. Troubleshoot, Iterate, Expand

* Keep habits tiny, expand naturally over time.
* Don’t push too hard—let success fuel growth.

## 🔄 Untangling Bad Habits

* **Phase 1: Focus on Creating New Habits**

  * New positive habits weaken old ones by replacement.

* **Phase 2: Focus on Stopping the Old Habit**

  * Change prompts (remove, avoid).
  * Break the “ability chain” → make it harder to do.
  * Reduce motivation triggers.

* **Phase 3: Swap a New Habit for the Old One**

  * Replace an unwanted habit with a beneficial one.
  * Make the swap small and stealthy.
