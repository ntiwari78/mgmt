# 📘 Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less

*By Greg McKeown *

> “If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will.”

Essentialism is about focusing on **less but better** — distinguishing what is truly important from everything else.

## 🔑 4 Core Principles

### 1. **Essence**

* Choice is an **action**, not a thing.
* Essentialists know they **can’t do it all** — instead, they focus on what really matters.
* Ask yourself: *“Do I absolutely love this?”*
* Remember: You always have a choice. There’s always a trade-off.

### 2. **Explore**

* See the **bigger picture**, don’t get lost in details.
* Essentialists **listen to understand**; nonessentialists listen to reply.
* Ask: *“How can this be learned?”*
* Create space: time to think, read, play, and rest.
* Journaling clears noise and gives perspective.
* Sleep and play are essential for creativity.

### 3. **Eliminate**

* Ask: *“What do I really want?”*
* Eliminate decisions that don’t align with your true goals.
* Cut losses → escape sunk-cost traps.
* Don’t solve other people’s problems for them.
* Learn to say **“No”** gracefully — it’s about clarity, not rejection.
* **Leave out the irrelevant** — keep only what inspires and drives you.

### 4. **Execute**

* Expect the **unexpected** → build buffers (+50%).
* Be clear on the outcome.
* List the obstacles.
* Remove what slows you down.
* Start small, celebrate progress.
* Build **routines** to find your flow and make effort feel effortless.

## 🎯 Core Takeaways

* **Less but better**: Do fewer things, but with more focus and excellence.
* **Trade-offs**: Accept them as part of every choice.
* **Say no**: Protect your energy by eliminating the trivial.
* **Flow through routines**: Structure your life so that progress becomes natural.
