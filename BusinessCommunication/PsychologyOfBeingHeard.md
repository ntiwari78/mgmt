## 🎧 The Psychology of Being Heard

### 12 Simple Moves That Make People (Actually) Listen

---

1. **“Let me get your thoughts on something”**
   Ask before sharing — this commits the listener’s brain and helps create engagement.

2. **Drop your volume slightly when making key points**
   A quieter tone creates a natural lean-in effect, commanding attention.

3. **Use “what if” before sharing solutions**
   This sparks creativity and opens minds to new ideas.

4. **Mirror their words thoughtfully in your response**
   Writing down or repeating key phrases ensures precision and shows understanding.

5. **Start with “I noticed” instead of “I think”**
   Transforms opinions into observations, boosting credibility.

6. **Pause briefly after they finish speaking**
   Watch their body language during the pause to pick up unspoken cues.

7. **Take a sip of water before key points**
   Creates natural thinking space without awkward silence.

8. **Lead with what you see, not what you assume**
   Describe observed behaviors instead of making judgments.

9. **Use people’s names thoughtfully**
   Saying their name at the start and end of key points deepens connection.

10. **Stand up for important conversations**
    Moving to a different space signals importance.

11. **Subtly nod while others speak**
    Combine with focused eye contact to show attentiveness and respect.

12. **End with “What are your thoughts?”**
    Invite responses and give them time to process and reply fully.
