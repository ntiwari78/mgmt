# 🗣️ 6 Structures to Survive & Thrive in Spontaneous Speaking

*From Thinking Fast, Talk Smart by Matt Abrahams*

These frameworks help organize thoughts quickly when speaking **on the spot** — in meetings, presentations, interviews, or Q&A sessions.

---

## 1. **Problem – Solution – Benefit**

* **Formula**: *Problem → Solution → Benefit*
* **Use Case**: Proposing changes, answering “How should we fix this?”

**Example**:

* **Problem**: “Our project deadlines are slipping because task handoffs aren’t clearly defined.”
* **Solution**: “We should introduce a shared project tracker with defined owners for each task.”
* **Benefit**: “This will reduce confusion, speed up progress, and ensure accountability.”

---

## 2. **What? – So What? – Now What?**

* **Formula**: *State fact → Explain importance → Suggest action*
* **Use Case**: Status updates, answering “Why does this matter?”

**Example**:

* **What?**: “We’ve seen a 20% increase in customer support tickets this month.”
* **So What?**: “This signals a potential product usability issue that could hurt retention.”
* **Now What?**: “Let’s analyze the top issues and prioritize fixes in the next sprint.”

---

## 3. **Comparison**

* **Formula**: *Option A → Option B → Recommendation*
* **Use Case**: Decision-making discussions, trade-off analysis.

**Example**:

* **Option A**: “We can outsource development, which reduces workload but increases cost.”
* **Option B**: “Or, we build in-house, which keeps costs down but delays launch.”
* **Recommendation**: “Given our timeline pressure, outsourcing part of the work is the better choice.”

---

## 4. **Timeline (Past – Present – Future)**

* **Formula**: *Past → Present → Future*
* **Use Case**: Storytelling, project updates, vision-sharing.

**Example**:

* **Past**: “Last year, we launched the beta version with 500 test users.”
* **Present**: “Today, we have 5,000 active users and growing demand.”
* **Future**: “Next, we plan to expand into new regions and roll out premium features.”

---

## 5. **Cause – Effect – Remedy**

* **Formula**: *Cause → Effect → Solution*
* **Use Case**: Root cause analysis, addressing challenges.

**Example**:

* **Cause**: “Customer churn has increased because our onboarding process is too complex.”
* **Effect**: “This is leading to lost revenue and higher acquisition costs.”
* **Remedy**: “We should simplify onboarding and add guided tutorials to help new users succeed.”

---

## 6. **Point – Reason – Example – Point (PREP)**

* **Formula**: *Point → Reason → Example → Repeat Point*
* **Use Case**: Q&A sessions, persuasive communication.

**Example**:

* **Point**: “We should prioritize mobile-first design.”
* **Reason**: “Because over 70% of our users access the app from mobile devices.”
* **Example**: “For instance, last quarter’s analytics showed that mobile engagement was 3x higher than desktop.”
* **Restated Point**: “That’s why a mobile-first strategy will best serve our users.”
