## Introduction

* Researchers spend **hundreds of hours each year** reading research papers.
* Despite its importance, **efficient reading is rarely taught**.
* This paper introduces the **Three-Pass Approach** as a practical method for reading research papers and conducting literature surveys.

## The Three-Pass Approach

Instead of reading papers linearly, read them in **three structured passes**:

### 1. First Pass — *Bird’s-Eye View* (5–10 minutes)

Goal: Decide whether to read further.
Steps:

* Read **title, abstract, introduction**
* Skim **headings and subheadings**
* Read **conclusions**
* Glance at **references**, noting familiar ones

At the end, answer the **Five Cs**:

1. **Category** – What type of paper is this?
2. **Context** – What prior work/theory is it based on?
3. **Correctness** – Do the assumptions seem valid?
4. **Contributions** – What are the main contributions?
5. **Clarity** – Is it well written?

### 2. Second Pass — *Understanding Content* (up to 1 hour)

Goal: Summarize the main thrust of the paper.
Actions:

* Read carefully, skipping proofs/details
* Examine figures and graphs for correctness (labels, error bars, statistical significance)
* Annotate margins or jot down key points
* Mark unfamiliar references for later

Result: Ability to explain the paper’s main idea to someone else.

---

### 3. Third Pass — *Deep Understanding* (1–5 hours)

Goal: Reconstruct and critically analyze the paper.
Actions:

* Virtually **re-implement the paper**: redo assumptions, recreate results
* Challenge assumptions, methods, and techniques
* Compare your reconstruction with the authors’ work
* Note strengths, weaknesses, missing citations, and open questions

Result: Ability to **reproduce the paper’s structure from memory** and critically evaluate it.

## Doing a Literature Survey

The three-pass approach scales to literature reviews:

1. **Search**: Use academic search engines (e.g., [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), [CiteSeer](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/)) with good keywords. Do a first pass on 3–5 recent papers.
2. **Trace Citations**: Identify recurring authors/papers in bibliographies. Collect their key works.
3. **Scan Top Venues**: Visit websites of top conferences in the field. Skim recent proceedings for high-quality related work.

Iteratively expand your survey until you cover the **core papers** in the area.

## Experience

* Keshav has used this method for **15 years** to review conference papers, write reviews, and do background research.
* It helps balance between **big-picture overview** and **deep detail** depending on the task.

## Key Takeaways

* Don’t read papers linearly; use **progressive passes**.
* The **first pass** is enough for papers outside your field.
* The **second pass** builds a working knowledge.
* The **third pass** yields deep understanding and critique.
* The method also supports **efficient literature surveys**.
