# ✍️ On Writing Well — Summary (William Zinsser)

## 1. The Foundation: Clear Thinking, Clear Writing

* **Writing is Personal**

  * Every word reveals the writer.
  * Readers want the *person* behind the words.
  * Write for yourself → if it interests you, it will interest others.
  * Don’t imagine a “mass audience.”

* **Simplicity**

  * Strip every sentence.
  * Ask: *What am I trying to say? Have I said it clearly?*
  * Cut clutter → eliminate every word that serves no function.
  * First drafts can often be cut by **50%**.

* **Style: Finding Your Voice**

  * Style = who you are, stripped down.
  * Relax, say what you want.
  * Read aloud → good writing is musical.
  * Trust your ear over rules.

## 2. The Methods: Craft & Attitude

* **Words**

  * Use active verbs → momentum.
  * Avoid filler adjectives/adverbs.
  * Short sentences > long ones.
  * Prefer specifics → vague writing is invisible.

* **Unity**

  * Pick one and stick with it: pronoun, tense, tone, scope.

* **The Lead & The Ending**

  * The lead must capture immediately.
  * Your lead shows readers why they should care.
  * Endings: don’t fizzle—surprise or resonate.
  * Sometimes the best ending is in your middle → find it.

## 3. The Forms: Mastering Nonfiction

* **The Interview**

  * Listen for *stories*, not just answers.
  * Use prepared questions but follow tangents.
  * Quote exactly → don’t paraphrase too much.

* **Writing About Places**

  * Capture what makes it unique.
  * Use *all senses*, not just sight.
  * Specific detail makes places alive.

* **Writing About Yourself**

  * Small truths reveal universal ones.
  * Be honest—failures and embarrassments included.
  * Memoir ≠ autobiography → memoir is selective.

* **Science & Technology**

  * Translate complexity through **stories and analogies**.
  * Don’t overcomplicate—if you don’t understand, keep reporting.

* **Business Writing**

  * Humanity > jargon.
  * Write like a human to humans.
  * Prefer “I, we, you.”

* **Humor**

  * Control and surprise = humor.
  * Don’t signal jokes—deliver them straight.

## 4. The Process

* **Bits & Pieces**

  * Verbs are the most important words.
  * Cut unnecessary adverbs, exclamations.
  * Short sentences work best.

* **Rewriting**

  * Real writing happens in revision.
  * Ask: Is it clear? Can anything be cut?
  * Cut ruthlessly—if it doesn’t add, it detracts.

* **Write for the Ear**

  * Writing is for the ear → read aloud.
  * Write as you’d speak, then edit for clarity and rhythm.

## 5. The Attitudes: Professional Mindset

* **Enjoyment**

  * If you enjoy writing, readers will enjoy reading.
  * Write about what gives you pleasure.

* **Trust Your Material & Get Out of the Way**

  * Your subject is more interesting than your opinions about it.
  * Show, don’t tell.
  * Trust readers to understand.

* **Process Over Product**

  * Don’t chase perfection—write to learn.
  * Each draft teaches.
  * When stuck, ask: *What would I say to a friend?*

## 6. The Final Wisdom

  * Respect the reader.
  * Humanity and warmth are your greatest assets.

* **The Professional Standard**
