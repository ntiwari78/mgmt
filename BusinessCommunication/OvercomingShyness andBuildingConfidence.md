## 1. The Pervasiveness and Impact of Shyness

Vin Jiang reveals that **over 50%** of his students experience *crippling shyness*, which affects their:

* Ability to speak up at work
* Forming new relationships
* Overall quality of life

> “It stops them from getting the most out of life.”

He shares a personal story of social anxiety, where his nerves at a networking event led him to misrepresent himself as a *musician* instead of a *magician*, emphasizing the real-world consequences of shyness.

## 2. The Root Cause of Shyness: Self-Centricity

Jiang identifies **self-centric thinking** as the primary cause of shyness. Common internal thoughts include:

* “I’m not interesting enough.”
* “What if I forget what I’m going to say?”
* “I’m not funny.”

> “It’s all very *me* centric... *me, me, me*.”

This excessive inward focus leads to fear and hesitation. Shifting the focus outward is a key part of overcoming shyness.

## 3. The Incremental Journey: From Shyness to Confidence

Jiang introduces an intermediary step in the confidence journey:

> “You don’t go from shy to confident overnight. The step in the middle is *not sounding or looking shy*.”

This process involves:

* Faking outward confidence through **behavioral cues**
* Receiving **positive feedback** from others
* Internalizing confidence over time

> “We become the things we most consistently practice.”
