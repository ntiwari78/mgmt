“Dig within. Within is the wellspring of Good; and it is always ready to
bubble up, if you just dig.” - Marcus Aurelius

“To bear trials with a calm mind robs misfortune of its strength and
burden." - Seneca

“The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing." We need to be prepared for sudden attacks.
Nobody will ever tackle a dancer. The dancer will never get choked by adversity like a wrestler. 
So, as warrior-philosophers, we know that life will be challenging. Actually, we should even be rubbing our hands
together and be looking forward to take some punches, knowing they will make us stronger and grow our skin thicker.
