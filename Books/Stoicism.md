together and be looking forward to take some punches, knowing they will make us stronger and grow our skin thicker.

Marcus Aurelius

pleasure? In short, to be coddled or to exert yourself?” - Marcus Aurelius

discontent, and such a person has strength, courage, and endurance—
unlike the angry and complaining. The nearer a man comes to a calm
mind, the closer he is to strength." - Marcus Aurelius
