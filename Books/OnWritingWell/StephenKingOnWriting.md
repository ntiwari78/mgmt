# ✍️ *On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft* by Stephen King

A blend of autobiography and writing guidance, *On Writing* (2000) offers both personal insights and practical advice from one of modern literature’s most prolific authors ([Wikipedia][1]).

---

## 🧩 1. Write Often & Read Always

* **“Read a lot and write a lot.”** This is King’s prime rule—reading widely sharpens your writing; writing regularly hones your skills ([Medium][2]).
* **Carry a book** to steal moments for reading—waiting rooms, checkouts, even during commutes ([Medium][2]).

---

## 🛠️ 2. Establish a Writing Routine

* Treat writing like a job: every morning, with daily targets (e.g., \~2,000 words) ([willpatrick.co.uk][3], [Wikipedia][4]).
* Keep healthy routines—physical fitness, strong relationships—to support creativity ([willpatrick.co.uk][3]).

---

## 🔧 3. The “Toolbox”

Writing essentials:

* Vocabulary, grammar, style, paragraphing ([Wikipedia][1]).
* Focus on **strong verbs**, active voice, and minimize adverbs ([Barnes & Noble][5]).

---

## 🧠 4. Write With the Door Closed; Edit With It Open

* Draft privately (“for yourself”), then revise with audience feedback ([Turner Stories][6], [Barnes & Noble][5]).
* First draft is for discovery; second draft is for clarity and shaping.

---

## 🧱 5. Build Paragraph by Paragraph

King considers the **paragraph** as the fundamental storytelling unit—stacking coherent paragraphs builds strong narrative flow ([Hunting the Muse][7]).

---

## 🧎‍♂️ 6. “Stories Are Found Things”—Organic Development

* Begin with a “what-if” premise; let characters and plot unfold naturally ([rleighturner.com][8]).
* Stories are unearthed, not fabricated—writer’s job is to excavate and polish ([Wikipedia][9]).

---

## 💬 7. The Power of Telepathy

Great writing acts like telepathy: transporting readers into the writer’s mind and scene ([Rick Lindquist][10]).

---

## 🗑️ 8. Trim the Fat

* Eliminate distractions—adverbs, passive voice, unnecessary words ([Barnes & Noble][5]).
* Writing is rewriting: cut \~10% (King’s golden rule) in second draft ([Wikipedia][4]).

---

## 🧬 9. Purpose Over Prestige

* Don’t write for fame or money—write to **enrich lives**: yours and your readers’ ([Nat Eliason][11]).

---

## 👪 10. Writing as Sustenance

* Share your process and struggles: King weaves in reflections on health, marriage, addiction, resilience after surviving a car accident ([Wikipedia][1]).

---

## 📅 11. Structure of the Book

1. **C.V.** – King’s personal history and influences
2. **What Writing Is** – his philosophy
3. **Toolbox** – mechanics of craft
4. **On Writing** – practical techniques
5. **On Living: A Postscript** – accident and recovery ([Wikipedia][1])
