### 1. **Writing is a Habit, Not an Art**

* Writing regularly beats writing sporadically: *“Don’t write a lot — just write often.”* ([12min.com][1])
* Cultivate a routine during your freshest hours. ([12min.com][1], [janezhang.ca][2])

### 2. **Start with Your Reader in Mind**

* Write **to one person**, using *you* rather than generic pronouns. ([12min.com][1])
* Combine **utility, inspiration, and empathy**; missing any one results in “a big fat zero.” ([Fluxe Digital Marketing][3])

### 3. **Craft Strong Opens and Closes**

* **Lede (intro)**: hook with a relatable problem, context, question, statistic, or anecdote. ([willpatrick.co.uk][4])
* **Kicker (conclusion)**: echo the theme, deliver a tonal twist, or end with a compelling quote. ([willpatrick.co.uk][4])

### 4. **Use the Ugly First Draft**

* Begin messy and imperfect to break free: *“Write like crap if you have to… Keep the streak alive.”* ([Medium][5])

### 5. **Follow a Clear Writing Process**

Typical steps:

1. Define your goal
2. Empathize with the reader
3. Gather data/examples
4. Outline structure
5. Draft → revise → headline → finalize → publish
6. Add a defined **call-to-action**: *“what now?”* ([Matt Tillotson][6])

### 6. **Clarity & Brevity**

* Short paragraphs & sentences, clear words, and smart formatting (bullets, subheads). ([willpatrick.co.uk][4])
* Place important words at the start of sentences. ([Fluxe Digital Marketing][3])
* Remove fluff, clichés, jargon, and overused adverbs. ([willpatrick.co.uk][4])

### 7. **Show, Don’t Tell**

* Use vivid details, stories, and analogies rather than vague claims. ([Pepper Content][7])

### 8. **Use Strong, Active Voice**

* Prefer active verbs (e.g., “raid” vs. “was raided”) and energetic language. ([willpatrick.co.uk][4])

### 9. **The Importance of Editing**

* Do both developmental (big picture) and line editing (cutting fat). ([willpatrick.co.uk][4])
* Final check: readability via tools like Hemingway App or Yoast. ([willpatrick.co.uk][4])

### 10. **Write with Humanity**

* Speak like a real person: avoid “Weblish”, use authentic voice, possibly fragments or “and/but” to add punch. ([12min.com][1])
