# 🧠 *How Not to Be Wrong* by Jordan Ellenberg

> *Mathematics isn't just about numbers — it's a way of thinking that helps us reason more clearly, avoid errors, and make better decisions in life, science, and society.*

## 📌 Core Premise

### 📐 Mathematics as a Way of Thinking

* Math is a **framework for logical reasoning and decision-making**.
* It helps uncover patterns and structures in complex problems.
* Used effectively, math enhances decisions in **science, policy, economics, and daily life**.

## 🔍 Mathematical Thinking in Action

### ❌ Non-Obvious Errors

* We often **misapply intuition** or overlook structure.
* Math helps **identify and correct** these errors *systematically*.

### 🌍 Modeling the Real World

> “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” — George Box

* Models simplify reality to test assumptions and make predictions.
* Understanding a model’s **limits** is key.

#### "Where Are the Missing Bullets?"

* WWII story on bullet hole data illustrates **[survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)**.
* Always ask: *What data is missing?*

#### Beware the Invisible Denominator

* Don’t draw conclusions without knowing the full data set (denominator).

## 🔑 Key Principles and Insights

### 1. 📋 The Importance of Assumptions

* Always examine what’s being measured and what’s omitted.
* Question default assumptions in models and arguments.

### 2. 📈 Linear Thinking vs. Nonlinear Reality

* Real-world systems are often **nonlinear**.
* **Small inputs** can have big effects, and vice versa.
* **Regression to the Mean**: Extreme results are usually followed by more average ones.

### 3. 🎲 Probabilistic Reasoning

#### Understanding Uncertainty

* Probability helps manage uncertainty, not eliminate it.
* Use **Bayesian reasoning** to update beliefs with new data.

#### The Prosecutor’s Fallacy

* Misunderstanding conditional probability can lead to faulty logic in courts and beyond.

### 4. 🎯 Risk and Expectation

#### Expected Value

* Combines outcomes with their probabilities.
* Helps in **weighing risky decisions** rationally.

#### Don’t Ignore Low-Probability, High-Impact Events

* Math encourages *rational attention* to rare but catastrophic risks (e.g., financial crashes).

### 5. 🔗 Correlation, Causation, and Confounding

#### Correlation ≠ Causation

* Just because two variables move together doesn’t mean one causes the other.

#### Multiple Comparisons Problem

* In large datasets, some correlations appear by **random chance**.
* Statistical significance must be used cautiously.

## 🧮 The Limits and Power of Math

### ⚖️ Math Can Clarify, Not Decide

* Math is a tool for **understanding**, not for making **moral or political judgments**.

### ❓ Use Math to Ask Better Questions

> “Framing a problem correctly is often more important than solving it quickly.”

---

## 🧭 Applications Across Life

### 🏛️ Policy and Public Discourse

* Use math to analyze data and arguments in **politics, economics, and media**.
* Helps cut through **misleading statistics** and rhetoric.

### 🧬 Personal Decisions

* In health, investing, or risk management, math helps **optimize choices** under uncertainty.

| 🧠 Math is reasoning                         | Think clearly, not just calculate           |
| ❗ Question assumptions                       | Models and stats often hide biases          |
| 🎲 Use probability wisely                    | Manage uncertainty, don’t eliminate it      |
| ⚖️ Don’t conflate correlation with causation | Statistical caution is key                  |
| 🔍 Math refines questions                    | It's a thinking tool, not an answer machine |
