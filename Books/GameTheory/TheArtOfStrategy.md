## 🧠 Strategic Thinking Is About Anticipating Others

* Success often comes from **seeing your decisions as part of a larger game**.
* **Game theory** helps predict how others will act and how to shape outcomes by adjusting your own choices.

## 🎮 Fundamentals of Game Theory

### 🎲 Types of Games

* **Zero-sum vs. Non-zero-sum**: One winner vs. possible mutual gains.
* **Simultaneous vs. Sequential**: Do players move together or take turns?
* **Perfect vs. Imperfect Information**: Can players observe all moves or not?

### 🪞 Reframing the Game

* Change incentives, rules, or order of moves to **influence outcomes**.
* Example: Restructuring payoffs or altering terms in a negotiation.

### 🔄 Think Forward, Reason Backward

* Begin with the **desired result**, then work backward to decide the best first move.
* Used in strategy from **military planning** (e.g., Cuban Missile Crisis) to **business deals**.

## ♟️ Strategic Tools and Moves

### 🔐 Credible Commitments

* Commitments influence others if they’re **believable**.
* E.g., Odysseus tying himself to the mast; companies using **strategic self-limitation**.

### 🗣️ Threats, Promises, and Signals

* Influence expectations—but only if seen as credible.
* Examples: **price-matching**, public declarations, and precommitments.

### 🧠 Strategic Use of Information

* **Signaling**: Share selective info to shape beliefs.
* **Screening**: Create conditions that reveal hidden info (e.g., interviews, education).

---

## ⚖️ Games of Conflict and Cooperation

### 🤝 The Prisoner’s Dilemma

* Cooperation is ideal, but self-interest may prevent it **without trust or enforcement**.

### 🌍 Tragedy of the Commons

* Shared resources get overused without **rules or norms**.

### 🔁 Repeated Games and Reputation

* Trust and punishment stabilize cooperation over time.
* Example: **Tit-for-Tat** strategy in repeated interactions.

---

## 🏢 Applications in Business and Life

### 💬 Negotiation and Bargaining

* Use **patience, credibility, and structure** to create win-win offers.

### 🔨 Auctions and Bidding Strategies

* Understand formats (e.g., sealed-bid vs. English auction).
* Beware of **the winner’s curse** (overpaying due to uncertainty).

### 🗳️ Voting and Collective Decisions

* Voting systems (e.g., ranked-choice) shape group outcomes.
* Use agenda-setting or strategic voting to **influence decisions**.

### 🏛️ Competitive Strategy

* Deter rivals by **shaping their incentives** (e.g., price wars, capacity threats).

---

## 🛠️ Practical Tools for Everyday Strategy

### 🎲 Use Mixed Strategies

* Stay **unpredictable** with randomization (e.g., in sports or negotiations).

### 🔒 Pre-Commit to Avoid Temptation

* Use devices to limit options and strengthen **self-control** and credibility.

### ⏱️ Control Timing

* First movers shape expectations; late movers adapt.
* Timing depends on the game’s structure.

---

## 🧩 Thinking Like a Game Theorist

### 🧮 Simplify Complex Situations

* Break down interactions into **players, strategies, and payoffs**.

### 🔁 Anticipate Reactions

> “What will the other person do in response to my move?”

### 💡 Understand Incentives

* People’s actions are clearer when you understand their **true motivations**.

### 👁️ Be Aware of Bias and Blind Spots

* Emotions and poor reasoning skew decision-making, even with good intent.

---

## 🧭 Conclusion: Strategy as a Life Skill

* Strategy is about **clarity, foresight, and adaptability**, not manipulation.
* Learning to “see the game” and “shape the game” is valuable in:

  * Business
  * Politics
  * Relationships
  * Daily decisions

> *Game theory is a mindset that sharpens decision-making in an interconnected world.*
