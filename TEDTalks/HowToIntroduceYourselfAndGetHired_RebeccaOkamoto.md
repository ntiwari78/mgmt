## The Challenge of "Tell Me About Yourself"

## A Personal Wake-Up Call

After starting my own business, I landed an interview to be an instructor at a supply chain institute. I came prepared with:

* Over 20 years of experience leading supply chains
* A polished elevator pitch
* A comprehensive list of accomplishments

But when I confidently answered *"Tell me about yourself"*, the interviewer responded:

> "Instead of talking about yourself, it would have been more effective if you had explained what you can do for me."

The interview lasted five minutes. I was rejected.

## The Turning Point

This experience taught me that **being qualified isn't enough**—you must **capture attention** quickly and meaningfully. I dedicated myself to:

* Studying the [science of first impressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_impression_%28psychology%29)
* Researching [viral headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait)
* Perfecting a 20-word introduction

## A New Approach to Introductions

> *“I’m a communications consultant and I help people with something to say but struggle to say it.”*

She leaned in and replied: *“Tell me more.”*
Fifteen minutes later, she hired me.

**The only difference?** My introduction.

> **Your introduction didn’t open the door.**
