# 2. Elements of Negotiations
### Basic Characteristics of Negotiation 

- Involves two or more parties (individuals, groups, or organizations)  
  - Parties can be co-workers, buyers and sellers, business owners, etc.
- Can also involve multiple parties in multi-party negotiations  
  - Parties can engage in trade-offs and face challenges in finding common ground
- Multi-party negotiations present difficult challenges  
  - Coalition formation
  - Majority rule
  - Consensus
  - Process management issues
  - Fluctuating matter of each party's best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA)
## Interdependence

### Interdependence in Negotiation 

- Interdependence is a key characteristic of negotiation where parties need each other to achieve their preferred objectives or outcomes.
  
  - Coordination is necessary to achieve individual objectives, or working together leads to better outcomes.
- Example: Two companies, A and B, negotiate a supply contract where A needs unique materials from B, and B relies on A's large customer base for sales.
  
  - Both companies are interdependent and need to work together to find an agreement that ensures sufficient supply for A and fair pricing for B.

### Types of Relationships in Negotiation

- Relationships between parties in negotiation can be independent, dependent, or interdependent.
  
  - Dependence: One party relies heavily on the other, but the other party's success isn't significantly impacted.
    
    - Example: Small business relying on a major retailer for sales.
  - Independence: Each party's success depends solely on their own actions, without the help of others.
    
    - Example: Two companies selling different products to different audiences.

### Degrees of Interdependence

- The degree of interdependence can vary based on the depth and duration of the relationship.
  
  - Shallow and short-term interdependency: Transactions between strangers, e.g., purchase of a car.
  - Deeper interdependency: Repeat transactions between parties, creating a long-term relationship.
  - Very deep interdependency: Long-term relationship of equal standing, e.g., a business partnership.

### Competitive and Mutual Gain Situations

- Competitive situation: Goals are interconnected, leading to a zero-sum or distributive bargaining.
  
  - One person's goal achievement blocks the other party's goal attainment.
- Mutual gain situation: Goals are linked so that one person's goal achievement helps others to achieve their goals, creating a non-zero-sum or integrated situation.
  
  - Example: Sharing an orange between two sisters.
  - Win-win or integrative situations are better than zero-sum or distributive situations.

### Evaluation of Influence 

- The desirability of alternatives to working together heavily influences the evaluation of influence
  
  - Agreement in negotiation depends on the attractiveness of the best available alternative, known as BATNA
  - It's important to identify one's own BATNA and determine the other party's BATNA during negotiations
- The upcoming sessions will provide more detailed information about BATNA

### Interdependence of Negotiation

- Negotiation involves interdependence, where parties need to work together for better outcomes
  
  - The characteristic of interdependence in negotiation will be further discussed in the upcoming sessions

## Give and Take Process

### Give and Take Process in Negotiations

- Both sides modify or move away from their opening statements, requests, or demands.
  
  - Example of negotiation between Sheila (buyer) and Max (seller) over a sari.
  - Max makes multiple price concessions from 5,000 to 3800 rupees.
- Concession refers to a deviation in an offer towards the other party's interest, reducing expected benefits.
  
  - Sheila's move from 3500 to 3800 and Max's price adjustments are concessions.
- Both parties modify their opening positions to reach an agreement.

### Positions and Interests in Negotiation

- Positions are surface statements of what a person or organization wants in a negotiation.
  
  - They rarely provide insight into underlying motivations, values, or incentives.
- Interests are the underlying motivations or reasons behind a party's position.
  
  - Understanding interests allows for more productive negotiation and exploration of creative solutions.
- Example of buyer and seller's interests influencing negotiation over a car purchase.
  
  - Buyer prioritizes affordability and functionality, while the seller's interest is in paying off debts and getting a fair value for the car.

### Importance of Interests in Negotiations 

- Positions tend to be fixed and rigid, requiring concessions from parties.
  
  - Modifying positions requires parties to make concessions either towards or away from the target point.
- Interests are broader and offer multiple ways to resolve conflicts.
  
  - Interests define what the parties care about more broadly.
  - Interests offer multiple ways to think about an issue.
- Focusing on interests in negotiations can lead to a mutually acceptable solution.
  
  - A focus on interests can lead to a win-win situation for both parties.
## Mutual Adjustment

### Mutual Adjustment in Negotiation 

- Negotiation is driven by mutual adjustment
  
  - Constant give and take affects negotiation landscape
  - Parties adjust strategies based on each other's actions
- Recognizing the dynamic and making concessions is crucial
  
  - Effective negotiators understand people's adjustments and the fluid nature of negotiation

### Dilemmas in Mutual Adjustment

- Dilemma of honesty
  
  - Concerns how much truth to disclose during negotiations
  - Telling everything may lead to disadvantage, while telling nothing may cause a stalemate
- Dilemma of trust
  
  - Concerns how much to believe of what the other party says
  - Trust may depend on the other party's reputation and current actions

### Building Trust in Negotiation

- Trust can be built through outcome perceptions
  
  - Convincing the other party that the proposed solution benefits them
- Trust can also be built through process perceptions
  
  - Fair and balanced proposal or give and take build trust

### Flexibility in Negotiation

- Parties need to be flexible about the negotiation processes
  
  - Protecting own interests while finding ways to satisfy others
  - Responding strategically to power tactics

### Decision Making in Negotiation

- Involves judgments and choices
  
  - Judgment: recognizing and evaluating opponent's content
  - Choice: selecting an option from the content or list of options presented
- Both sides need decision-making authority and commitment to the final deal

### Managing Tangibles and Intangibles

- Tangibles
  
  - Concrete elements (e.g., price, terms, delivery timelines)
  - Negotiators focus on bargaining over these aspects
- Intangibles
  
  - Underlying psychological motivations influencing parties
  - Affect judgment about what is fair or right in conflict resolution

### Importance of Honesty in Negotiation 

- "why do good negotiators never lie? why is it a fact they would not lie? because lying in negotiation damages trust and reputation making future negotiations challenging"
  
  - Skilled negotiators use tactics such as remaining silent, playing dumb, or blaming rules to avoid lying
  - Honesty builds trust and opens doors to mutually beneficial deals

### Key Elements of Negotiation

- Two or more parties
  
  - Interdependence, give and take process, mutual adjustment, flexibility, decision-making ability, managing tangibles, and resolving the intangibles
- Familiar everyday and business examples used for explaining the definition and key characteristics
  
  - Understanding the foundational elements of negotiation for ease of understanding the content
